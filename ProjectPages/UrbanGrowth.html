      In this project, we analyzed the construction timeline of buildings by classifying satellite imagery across different years. High-quality satellite images for the years 2000, 2013, and 2023 were downloaded and processed. Each image was classified to extract built-up areas, which were then converted from raster to polygon format for spatial analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      We retrieved all existing building footprints from Google Earth Engine (GEE) and spatially intersected them with the built-up area polygons for each year. Buildings intersecting with the 2000 built-up polygon were assigned the year 2000 in their attributes. The same process was repeated for 2013 and 2023, allowing us to estimate when each building was likely constructed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the buildings were symbolized based on the assigned year, visually representing urban expansion and construction trends over two decades. This analysis provides valuable insights for urban planning and change detection studies.
