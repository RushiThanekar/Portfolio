        <p>
          This project aimed to evaluate the hydrological behavior and flood vulnerability of town planning. We performed a comprehensive rainfall-runoff analysis using the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model, which simulates the impact of land use, soil properties, topography, and climate on watershed hydrology.
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin, we delineated the watershed and created Hydrological Response Units (HRUs) using input datasets such as soil maps, land use/land cover (LULC), and Digital Elevation Models (DEM). These datasets were accessed through MapSWAT, a tool that utilizes Google Earth Engine (GEE) to gather spatially accurate environmental data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the watershed was configured in SWAT, we simulated rainfall-runoff patterns to understand how water moves across the landscape during storm events. The model helped estimate surface runoff, infiltration, and flow accumulation, giving insight into how different sub-basins contribute to the total runoff.
        </p>
        <p>
          To assess flood risks and visualize potential flood spread, we used TUFLOW, a 2D hydraulic modeling software. By inputting runoff data from SWAT into TUFLOW, we simulated how water would propagate over the terrain during heavy rainfall events. This helped identify low-lying and flood-prone zones, providing a visual representation of flood impact areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          The combination of SWAT and TUFLOW models enabled us to create a realistic and spatially accurate assessment of flood risks. The results of this study offer valuable guidance for urban development, infrastructure planning, and disaster management strategies.
