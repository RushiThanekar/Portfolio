    <p>
      This project focused on delineating watershed boundaries and stream networks using open-source tools within QGIS. The process was carried out using the PCRaster Tools plugin, developed by Hans van der Kwast, which is well-known in the hydrology and spatial analysis community. PCRaster enables environmental modeling and geospatial analysis directly within QGIS, offering a powerful yet accessible workflow for hydrological tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      We used this plugin to process elevation data (DEM) and generate flow direction, flow accumulation, stream networks, and watershed boundaries. The delineation was done using raster-based operations, and we styled the outputs using QGISâ€™s symbology tools to ensure clear and professional visual presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To provide additional spatial context and make the results more informative, we overlaid OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, including roads, rivers, and infrastructure layers. This enriched the map and allowed better interpretation of the watershed in relation to real-world features like settlements and roads.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final output is a clean, insightful map showing natural drainage patterns, ideal for use in urban planning, flood risk assessment, and water resource management studies.
